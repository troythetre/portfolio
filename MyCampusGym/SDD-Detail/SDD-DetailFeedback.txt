==========================================

DETAILED CSC AND CSU DESCRIPTIONS:
   Well done on this section ~ nothing to add here.

DETAILED CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
   Adequate job on this section ~ nothing to add here.
   Note that usually in this kind of description, there is more of a list of
   the parts with individual descriptions.  For example, you list the method
   for creating a new feed conversation, but you don't say its name or its
   arguments.  This would be something that is typical in a detailed design.

DETAILED INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Good descriptions of what parts interact with what other parts ~ nothing
   to add here.

DETAILED DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Since your data structures are all part of swift, there is no need for a
   detailed section here, although it would be normal to define a bit more
   than simply "swift UI"...  Nothing to add here.

DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   The diagrams are colorful, but I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking at.
   It would be helpful, perhaps, to expand the diagrams a bit and label the
   arrows and connecting lines so that the associations and interactions can
   be understood.

DATABASE DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION:
   If you have a database, you need to specify the database design.  Saying
   the design 'is to be implemented' is kind of kicking the can down the
   road, so to speak.
   This really should be an "Entity-Relationship Diagram" or "ERD".  However
   since we are close to the end of the semester, I'm not going to make you
   do this part again.  The verbal descriptions are pretty good, since you
   talk about what the entities [tables] will be.
   In the "real" world, you'll have to have this as part of the document.
