=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Awesome job on the agile requirements!  You broke it down perfectly and
   everything there looks good.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Although this is in agile form, you should still label the functional
   requirements as such.  Same with the performance and environmental ones.

   This looks like you have ONLY functional requirements.  You still need to
   have some performance and environment requirements.  Even though an agile
   spec is easier to write, that doesn't mean it's easier because you are
   skipping these details, it just means easier because the *language* isn't
   quite so specific.

   The requirements you have look about right in terms of specifying the way
   the product will work, but you can always add more as the development
   proceeds and new things get uncovered.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Not done.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Not done.
