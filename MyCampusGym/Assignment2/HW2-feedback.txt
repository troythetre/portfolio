COMMENTS:

good point about smaller user stories meaning quicker delivery of working
software to the customer ~ good reason to make sure your user stories are on
the small side.  What about if the estimate itself is wrong, giving a false
idea on the size of the user story?  Something to consider.....

is 'homebrew' a build tool or an installation tool?  I haven't used it too
much, so I don't know, but it seems like it is most useful when installing a
piece of software that is needed for something you are building, but then it
has done its job once that software is installed...

just wondering!

nice work!
