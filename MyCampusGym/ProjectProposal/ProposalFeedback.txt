Project Proposal Feedback
Project: MyCampusGym
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
Nice job on the document.  I like the description, and having an application
which will help with keeping track of workouts can be a motivator for those
of us who tend to be a bit inconsistent about working out.  The check-in and
geo features are cool ideas, as is the discussion board!

The justification section is good, since it states the things you'll all be
working with and the goals of what you will do with each and what you will
get out of each.

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
Nice job on the proposal.  You all had a voice and the presentation was very
smooth.  You answered the questions well and faced the room, not the slides,
so we felt engaged.

My one suggestion is that a couple of the slides seemed a bit 'dense' with
too much text.  Try to make fewer bullets per slide and talk about each a
bit more rather than putting everything on the slides.  The audience will
remember what you said by looking at a few bullets as reminders instead of
trying to finish reading everything on the slides.

Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.
