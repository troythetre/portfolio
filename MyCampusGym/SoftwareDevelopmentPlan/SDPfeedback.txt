Software Development Plan
CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
=======================================
Not a bad job on this document.  All the parts are there, but I saw some
places where there is internally redundant information.  There are also a
couple of spelling errors that you might want to track down, such as using
"Tory" for "Troy"....

The other thing is, the Table of Contents should be at the top of the file,
not at the bottom...

Full credit on the document for its content, but make those changes as have
been specified above by the end of the semester for full credit on the whole
document submission.

Nice work!
