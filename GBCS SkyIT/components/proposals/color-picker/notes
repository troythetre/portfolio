1. color wheel selected color updated on color swatch (how should the interactions work with the color wheel??) 
2. auth code when color swatch is clicked instead of popping up color wheel
3. the color wheel should be popped up when the auth code window next button is clicked
4. the upload button and image are temporary placements
