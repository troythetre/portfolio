DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   These could use more detail to show what fields/methods/functions are in
   each of the boxes.  This will help augment the large amount of text you
   have [by necessity] in the previous sections.  What you have is just a
   repeat of what is in the architectural document so it needs more in this
   one.  Remember this is a later section of the same single 'design'
   document.

DATABASE DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION:
   Excellent job on this section ~ nothing to add here.
