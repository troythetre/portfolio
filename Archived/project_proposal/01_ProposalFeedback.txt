=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   This is interesting, Troy.  I had no idea what a 'beat' is until I read
   your proposal.  It made me want to do some research to find out more!  I
   like the way you have laid out the description of your project in the
   document, and your justification section is spot-on.

   Great!

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   Nice job on the presentation Troy!  I like the slides, the template you
   used is really cool.  You have good graphics in there.  The slides have
   completely described your project and I like the user interface you have
   shown.  The purpose and justification are good, and you have describied
   what you are implementing very well from the user's standpoint.

   With this much work put in already, it looks like this project has a good
   chance of being successful and also being monetized and making a start up
   happen.  You should make some time to visit with John Zimmerman when he
   visits us next month!

Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Great start to the semester so keep up the good work.
