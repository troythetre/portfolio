---------
Nice work!

On problem 4.2, the actual duration starts with the longest first task at G.
   The critical path then, is G, D, E, M, Q.  If there are no predecessors,
   those tasks start at the same time so pick the longest one as the start.
   There must be a path from task to task.  Total duration = 32 days.

On problem 4.4, this is not a Gantt chart, but I understand what you are
   trying to do to show the task durations.  Unfortunately, there are no days
   of the week associated with this, so it's impossible to tell when we're
   working and when we're not.

On problem 4.8, don't forget the one about adding people to an already late
   project making it later!

On problem 5.3, there are a couple of your answers which are inconsistent
   with the book's answers.  It should be:
      B, U&F, U&F, U&F, N, N, N, N, N, F, F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F
   pretty close, though...

On problem 5.9, EXCELLENT brainstorming for the ideas.

Your work on this assignment is VERY complete and detailed!  You did a great
job on it.  Just be sure to take a look at what a Gantt chart reall is and if
you need to discuss anything feel free to come by the office and chat!
