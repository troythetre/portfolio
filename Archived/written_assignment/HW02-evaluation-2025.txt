Comments:
---------

problem 5-1, good analysis.

problem 5-2, I think you'd really only need a monolithic architecture, but
   you've made a good case for the two you've listed.

problem 5-6, do you really need all that database horsepower to support a
   simple file storing situation?  You could also use utilities from the
   file system to maintain them.  You make good cases for your selections
   for all three of these questions, Troy!

problem 5-8, pretty good job with the ASCII art, but you could also just draw
   the diagram out on a piece of paper, take a cellphone picture, and embed
   that in the document or put a link to it in the document...  From the way
   this is drawn, it is difficult to show, for example, that multiple digits
   may be entered when in the 'fraction' state.

problem 6-2, you are pretty close.  Per the diagram I put up in class on the
   Wednesday meeting, you need a 'Drawable' class at the top.  Underneath it
   are two classes, 'LineDrawable' and 'Text'.  Under 'LineDrawable' you have
   'Line' and 'Fillable', and under 'Fillable' you have all the shapes.  In
   your diagram, you have text and line which are technically not shapes.

Excellent work ~ keep it up!
