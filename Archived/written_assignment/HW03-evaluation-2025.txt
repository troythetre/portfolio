Total possible score: 50 points
============================================================================

Your score: 49 out of 50 = 98% which is an A-plus

Comments/feedback:

problem 7-1, all you need to do is include a link to the wikipedia page, and
   then you can delete all the rest of the comments which become redundant.
   Good catch on the corrections to the code!

problem 8-11, the Lincoln index works on PAIRS, so you have three different
   calculations that must be averaged:

      Testing the three different Lincoln indexes:
      Alice/Bob 5*4/2 =10
      Alice/Carmen 5*5/2 = 12.5
      Bob/Carmen 4*5/1 = 20
      To estimate the bug you could take the average of the three.
      In this case, there are 14 bugs.

   Interesting equation you derived, though!  Also, interesting and thorough
   analysis of your results!  Well done!

You earned 98% of 11 points which is 10.78 extra credit points.
