# Archive

An IOS app, aims to be a cultural hub for “the underground”, fostering creative and intellectual exchanges of thought among users and creators. The Archive IOS app promotes three main pillars, the “3 C’s”: creativity, community, and content. Archived understands the importance of creative material, notably music and clothing, so we provide a platform for creatives, regardless of size and popularity, to impact underground culture. The longevity of the underground is dependent upon community-building and social engagement; therefore our app provides an ideal space for individuals to find like-minded communities and exchange personal thoughts with the world. Artists and underground content do not typically reach traditional news organizations, so our app capitalizes on these underrepresented creatives via independent journalism, social media, and other non-traditional methods.

# Splitz Stream App

# Shanghai Runchi Investment Fund: Stock Option Simulator 

Develop an options trading strategy based on the put-call parity theorem and leverage real-time market data for dynamic simulation. Perform comprehensive backtesting to assess the strategy's effectiveness and precisely measure gains and losses

# Phased-Locked Loop

As part of my IB extended essay, I developed a comprehensive analysis of nonlinear phase-locked loops using high-school calculus, going beyond the simplified linear analysis typically presented in university textbooks. I created a design procedure with optimal parameters to help novices build PLLs within specifications. This process was supported by a custom Python-based EDA tool I developed. The project was validated by constructing and testing a GPS local oscillator, demonstrating the effectiveness of the entire design chain.

# High School Varsity Basketball Statistics Analysis Website

As the captain of my high school basketball team, I created a game-changing tool that collects season stats from interactive replays of game videos. It analyzed and visualized the statistics, providing my coach with valuable insights for training players and strategizing the team. The program is written in HTML and JavaScript, allowing my coach to run it offline in any browser, anytime and anywhere.

# Logistic Growth Population Model

Witnessing poverty firsthand during my high school field trip, I realized that improper population control leads to misery. However, the logistic population model lacks sufficient accuracy, and the difficulty of solving differential equations hinders scientists from making progress. I applied my novel method to solve general Nth-order nonlinear differential equations, demonstrating a process that effectively overcomes these limitations and enables scientists to improve their models. This process is also extendable to other scientific fields.
